Thanks to Paulo Arruda to point me to mpeg4ip-utils when I didn't know how to extract the metadata from ALAC files. You can visit him at http://parruda.net/.



alac2flac is a shell script to convert ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec, used on iPod/iPhone/iPad files) format to FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec).

You can use it to convert a single .m4a file to .flac, like

 alac2flac file.m4a

Additionally, you can embed a gif, jpeg or png file as a cover-art, like

 alac2flac file.m4a cover.png

alac2flac will automatically grab the embedded cover-art, though.

alac2flac takes only one .m4a file as parameter (i.e. converts only one file per time). You can, however, convert all files in a given directory using a bash loop:

 for i in *m4a ; do alac2flac "$i" ; done

A easy way to install on Linux is making it executable and copying it to a directory in your path, like

 chmod +x alac2flac && sudo cp alac2flac /usr/local/bin

flac2m4a uses alac-decoder and flac to decode/encode the audio files, and grabs the metadata with mp4info. On Ubuntu, you can install them with

 sudo apt-get install flac alac-decoder mpeg4ip-utils

Enjoy.
